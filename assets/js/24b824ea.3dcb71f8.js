MACI enables collusion resistance for decentralised applications, particularly voting and quadratic funding systems. This release is a major upgrade to the project and provides better developer experience and gas savings for users.\\n\\nThe code is in the v1 branch of the appliedzkp/macirepository and will be merged soon.\\n\\nMACI 1.0 was audited by Hashcloak. All vulnerabilities found have been fixed. The audit report can be found here. We would like to thank our highly professional and responsive auditors for surfacing these issues and providing clear feedback for addressing them.\\n\\n## About MACI\\nMACI is a set of smart contracts and zero-knowledge circuits upon which which developers can build collusion-resistant applications, such as voting systems or quadratic funding platforms. MACI per se is not a user-facing application. Rather, developers may build applications on top of it. In turn, such applications can benefit from the following properties:\\n\\n- Collusion resistance: no-one, except a trusted coordinator, can be convinced of the validity of a vote, reducing the effectiveness of bribery.\\n- Receipt-freeness: a voter cannot prove, besides to the coordinator, which way they voted.\\n- Privacy: no-one, except a trusted coordinator, should be able to decrypt a vote.\\n- Uncensorability: no-one, not even the trusted coordinator, should be able to censor a vote.\\n- Unforgeability: only the owner of a user\u2019s private key may cast a vote tied to its corresponding public key.\\n- Non-repudiation: no-one may modify or delete a vote after it is cast, although a user may cast another vote to nullify it.\\n- Correct execution: no-one, not even the trusted coordinator, should be able to produce a false tally of votes.\\n\\n\\nPractically speaking, MACI provides a set of Typescript packages, Ethereum smart contracts and zero-knowledge circuits. It inherits security and uncensorability from the underlying Ethereum blockchain, ensures unforgeability via asymmetric encryption, and achieves collusion resistance, privacy, and correct execution via zk-SNARKs.\\n\\nPlease note that MACI does not and will not have a token. In other words, it does not represent an investment opportunity.\\n\\n## MACI\u2019s history\\n\\nMACI stems from an ethresear.ch post by Vitalik Buterin. Subsequently, the initial codebase was written in late 2019 and early 2020 by grantees with the Ethereum Foundation, namely Kendrick Tan, Koh Wei Jie, and Chih-Cheng Liang. MACI then saw developer adoption at ETHDenver in February 2020, where Auryn Macmillan and others started work on clr.fund, a protocol for the Ethereum community to allocate funds for Ethereum-based public goods.\\n\\nAfter the event, we continued to work with clr.fund to improve MACI and integrate it with their application. clr.fund has completed seven rounds of public goods funding, the last of which saw more than US$6000 worth of contributions. At the time of writing, it is currently running an eighth round with more than US$20k in contributions.\\n\\nWork on version 1.0 started in late 2020 with the goal of reducing the gas and computational requirements, as well as to improve its flexibility and usability, without compromising any of its anti-collusion, security, and trust guarantees. We also took this opportunity to keep up with new techniques, ideas, and tooling from the rapidly advancing Ethereum and zero-knowledge ecosystem.\\n\\nFinally, in early 2021 we were very fortunate to bring on Cory Dickson to the team. His work on writing documentation, revamping MACI\u2019s integration test suites, working with our auditors to fix bugs, and collaborating with external teams has been invaluable to the project.\\n\\n## Why is MACI important?\\nIt is very difficult for naive voting systems, particularly those which are integrated into smart contract platforms, to prevent collusion. For instance, if a simple Ethereum transaction represents a vote, a briber can easily examine its calldata, tell how its sender voted, and reward or punish them accordingly.\\n\\nMore broadly, collusion resistance is particulary important for cryptoeconomic systems. Vitalik Buterin describes the motivations behind MACI in On Collusion. He argues that systems that use cryptoeconomic incentive mechanisms to align participants\u2019 behaviour can be vulnerable to collusion attacks, such as bribery. In another post, he elaborates:\\n\\nif you can prove how you voted, selling your vote becomes very easy. Provability of votes would also enable forms of coercion where the coercer demands to see some kind of proof of voting for their preferred candidate.\\n\\nTo illustrate this point, consider an alleged example of collusion that occurred in round 6 of Gitcoin grants (a platform for quadratic funding software projects which contribute to public goods). In How to Attack and Defend Quadratic Funding, an author from Gitcoin highlights a tweet by a potential grant beneficiary appeared to offer 0.01 ETH in exchange for matching funds:\\n\\n\\nThey explain the nature of this scheme:\\n\\n> While creating fake accounts to attract matching funds can be prevented by sybil resistant design, colluders can easily up their game by coordinating a group of real accounts to \u201cmine Gitcoin matching funds\u201d and split the \u201cinterest\u201d among the group.\\n\\nFinally, MACI is important because as crypto communities are increasingly adopting Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) which govern through token voting. The threat of bribery attacks and other forms of collusion will only increase if left unchecked, since such attacks target a fundamental vulnerability of such systems.\\n\\n## What\u2019s new?\\n\\nIn this release, we rearchitected MACI\u2019s smart contracts to allow for greater flexiblity and separation of concerns. In particular, we support multiple polls within a single instance of MACI. This allows the coordinator to run and tally many elections either subsequently or concurrently.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve kept the ability for developers to provide their own set of logic to gate-keep signups. For instance, application developers can write custom logic that only allows addresses which own a certain token to sign up once to MACI in order to participate in polls.\\n\\nAn additional upgrade we have implemented is greater capacity for signups, votes, and vote options. With MACI 1.0, a coordinator can run a round that supports more users, votes, and choices than before, even with the same hardware.\\n\\nWe adopted iden3\u2019s tools for faster proof generation. Furthermore, we rewrote our zk-SNARK circuits using the latest versions of snarkjs, circom, and circomlib. We also developed additional developer tooling such as circom-helper and zkey-manager.\\n\\nFinally, we significantly reduced gas costs borne by users by replacing our incremental Merkle tree contracts with a modified deposit queue mechanism. While this new mechanism achieves the same outcome, it shifts some gas costs from users to the coordinator. A comparison of approximate gas costs for user-executed operations is as follows:\\n\\nFinally, we are looking forward to collaborating with other projects and supporting their development of client applications and new use cases. For instance, clr.fund team has indicated that they would like to upgrade their stack to MACI v1.0, and other projects have expressed interest in adopting MACI. We hope that through collaboration, the Ethereum community can benefit from our work, and vice versa.\\n\\n## Further work\\nThere is plenty of space for MACI to grow and we welcome new ideas. We are keen to work with developers who wish to do interesting and impactful work, especially folks who would like to learn how to build applications with zk-SNARKs and Ethereum.\\n\\n### Negative voting\\n\\nWe thank Samuel Gosling for completing a grant for work on negative voting. This allows voters to use their voice credits to not only signal approval of a vote option, but also disapproval. Please note that the negative voting branch, while complete, is currently unaudited and therefore not yet merged into the main MACI codebase.\\n\\n### Anonymisation\\nA suggested upgrade to MACI is to use ElGamal re-randomisation for anonymity of voters. While all votes are encrypted, currently the coordinator is able to decrypt and read them. With re-randomisation, the coordinator would not be able to tell which user took which action.\\n\\n### Coordinator tooling\\nWe are working on tooling that makes it easier for coordinators to interface with deployed contracts and manage tallies for multiple polls. This will allow users to generate proofs and query inputs and outputs from existing circuits through an easy-to-use API. We hope that this will drive more adoption of MACI and offload the need for bespoke infrastructure.\\n\\n###Trusted setup\\nUnlike other ZKP projects, MACI does not have an official trusted setup. Instead, we hope to assist teams implementing MACI in their applications to run their own trusted setup. For instance, clr.fund recently completed a trusted setup (on a previous version of MACI) for a specific set of circuit parameters. Other teams may wish to use a different set of parameters on MACI 1.0, which calls for a different trusted setup.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThis release marks a step towards the hard problem of preventing collusion in decentralised voting and quadratic funding systems. We are excited to share our work and please get in touch if you are a developer and are interested in getting involved in any way."},{"id":"maci v1.1.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/maci/blog/maci v1.1.1","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2019-05-28-maci-v1.1.1.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-28-maci-v1.1.1.md","title":"Maci v1.1.1 Release","description":"We are pleased to announce the release of an updated version of MACI - Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure v1.1.1.","date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 28, 2019","tags":[{"label":"zk","permalink":"/maci/blog/tags/zk"},{"label":"maci","permalink":"/maci/blog/tags/maci"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/maci/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"voting","permalink":"/maci/blog/tags/voting"},{"label":"security","permalink":"/maci/blog/tags/security"}],"readingTime":6.715,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ctrlc03","title":"MACI team","url":"https://github.com/ctrlc03","image_url":"https://github.com/wgao19.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/wgao19.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"maci v1.1.1","title":"Maci v1.1.1 Release","authors":{"name":"ctrlc03","title":"MACI team","url":"https://github.com/ctrlc03","image_url":"https://github.com/wgao19.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/wgao19.png"},"tags":["zk","maci","release","voting","security"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"MACI 1.0 Release","permalink":"/maci/blog/MACI 1.0"}},"content":"We are pleased to announce the release of an updated version of MACI - Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure v1.1.1.\\n\\nThis new release brings a more secure product, new features, and a much needed documentation refresh. Before we dive into the updates, let\'s refresh your memory on what MACI is and what it was created to achieve.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nMACI is an application that provides collusion resistance for on-chain voting processes. It was originally created after Vitalik\'s [post](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413), and has since been revisited and improved. \\n\\nMACI revolves around the need for a trusted coordinator. The coordinator is in charge of setting up the system, publishing its public key, and computing the tally of the votes. Below are the main properties of MACI:\\n\\n| Property | Description |\\n| -------- | ----------- |\\n| Collusion Resistance | no-one except a trusted coordinator should be certain of the validity of a vote, reducing the effectiveness of bribery. |\\n| Receipt-freeness | no-one can prove (besides to the coordinator) which way they voted. |\\n| Privacy | no-one except a trusted coordinator should be able to decrypt a vote.|\\n| Uncensorability | no-one \u2014 not even the trusted coordinator, should be able to censor a vote. |\\n| Unforgeability | only the owner of a user\'s private key may cast a vote   tied to its corresponding public key. | \\n| Non-repudiation | no-one may modify or delete a vote after it is cast, although a user may cast another vote to nullify it.|\\n| Correct execution | no-one, not even the trusted coordinator, should be able to produce a false tally of votes. |\\n\\nSince its inception, MACI has been adopted by different projects, most notably [clr.fund](https://github.com/clrfund) and [QFI](https://github.com/quadratic-funding/qfi/tree/feat/code-freeze). These projects prove how effective MACI can be, especially when integrated with applications that are otherwise prone to collusion, such as funding Public Goods.\\n\\nFor a more detailed description of MACI, please refer to the [v1 technical introduction article](https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to-maci-1-0-db95c3a9439a).\\n\\n## Security Audit\\n\\nMACI was [audited](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/blob/v1/audit/202220930_Hashcloak_audit_report.pdf) by HashCloack in the summer of 2022. The audit team discovered certain high risk vulnerabilities, whose fixes were the focus of the MACI team in the past months. \\n\\nIn more details, the audit revealed two high risk issues within the zk-SNARK circuits:\\n\\n* Incomplete validation when processing messages\\n* Integer overflow which could have allowed users to affect a coordinator\'s effort of calculating the subsidy by either making it incorrect or by intercepting the calculation\\n\\nAnother notable security issue was the lack of initialization of the `AccQueue` contract. This contract is used to store messages (votes or topups) for the different polls. Without inserting a zero value hash into the merkle tree contract as the first message during initialization, a malicious user could have performed a denial of service attack on a poll. This could have resulted in the poll results taking a very long time before being tallied by the coordinator.\\n\\nAll of these issues have been successfully resolved, on top of fixing minor issues and general code optimizations. The updated product uses a more up to date and secure version of Solidity, and more thorough test cases to verify the correctness of the solution. \\n\\n## New Features\\n\\n| Feature  | Description |\\n| -------- | ----------- |\\n| [Top Up Credit](https://hackmd.io/@chaosma/rkyPfI7Iq) | Users can now top up credits rather than having to sign up with a different MACI key |\\n| [Pairwise Subsidy](https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553)| Enhanced protection against collusion in quadratic funding|\\n| [Coordinator Service](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/tree/v1/server) | Sample coordinator server for easier MACI use |\\n### Top Up Credit \\n\\nRather than requring a user to sign up multiple times, it is now possible to top up voice credits by sending a top up message on the Poll contract. Withdrawals are not enabled as this would allow a malicious user to bribe others offline to transfer their keys.  \\n\\nNow, the Poll contract will hold all the funds deposited from users for the current poll. At the end of a poll, the coordinator can transfer the funds to a hardcoded address which can be used to fund public goods. \\n\\nWhen a user deposits tokens by calling topup, they will also need to specify the stateTree index. The topup function will insert a topup message into the message queue for them. When the voting period ends, any call of topup function will be rejected. Both voting and topup messages have the same ending time, which ensures there is a well-defined ending state for each poll.\\n\\nPlease note that in this approach, the initial credit is still shared across multiple polls, and the actual credit an user can spend in a given poll is the following: `totalCredit=initialCredit+topupCredit` where the `topupCredit` is the voice credit amount deposited by the user during the voting period of the given pollID.\\n\\nFor a detailed description, please refer to this [document](https://hackmd.io/@chaosma/rkyPfI7Iq).\\n\\n### Pairwise Subsidy\\n\\nPairwise subsidy is a new way to reduce collusion in quadratic funding applications. If two contributors  collude with each other, they can extract most of the public funding pool if they have enough funds.\\n\\nIn this [post](https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553), Vitalik introduced this kind of collusion and also proposed a protocol to penalize this behavior. As a generalized solution, the more correlation between contributions, the smaller subsidy should be allocated to this project, as this reduces the risk of collusion between contributors. It should be noted that this solution assumes that an identity system is in place to prevent the same entity from registering with two different identities.\\n\\nPlease refer to this [post](https://hackmd.io/@chaosma/H1_9xmT2K) for a more detailed explaination of the implementation.\\n\\nFinally, please note that currently it is not possible to generate the `zkeys` for the subsidy circuit with with the `vote options` parameter larger than $5^2$. This issue is documented [here](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/issues/584) and the team will focus on finding a solution to be able to support larger vote options. \\n\\n### Coordinator Service\\n\\nMACI now includes a sample [coordinator service](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/tree/v1/server).\\n\\nThere are two roles in the cordinator service: admin (i.e. MACI coordinator) and user (i.e. a voter). The admin\'s responsibility is to ensure that the code remains updated and that the backend services are live. The user can then simply send HTTP requests to the backend server to interact with MACI, for instance, by signing up and publishing a message on chain.\\n\\nThe coordinator service has been wrapped into two docker instances: one for the backend server to accept user requests; one for the Mongodb service to store all necessary information on the current state such as smart contract addresses, zero knowledge proof keys and so on.\\n\\nFor further reading on coordinator services, please refer to this [doc](https://hackmd.io/@chaosma/SJtsfzKnF).\\n\\n## How to use MACI\\n\\nMACI can be used as a standalone application to carry out on-chain polls, or be implemented into new projects that can then benefit from its properties.\\n\\nFor use as a standalone application, a `cli` package is provided which allows coordinators and voters to use MACI. Please refer to this [doc](https://privacy-scaling-explorations.github.io/maci/cli.html) for details on how to use it.\\n\\nTo implement MACI into a project, the [documentation](https://privacy-scaling-explorations.github.io/maci/) can be used a reference, as well as reviewing how [clr.fund](https://github.com/clrfund) and [qfi](https://github.com/quadratic-funding/qfi/tree/feat/code-freeze) use MACI in their code.\\n\\n## MACI 0.x\\n\\nMACI version 0.x will be discontinued. MACI 1.x has feature parity, more robust code and newest features. Users are encouraged to use the latest version. Starting February 7, 2023, the team will focus solely on resolving issues for MACI 1.x, and will cease to provide support for version 0.x.\\n\\n## How to get involved\\n\\nShould you wish to get involved with MACI or simply report a bug, feel free to visit the [repository](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/tree/v1) and open an issue, or comment under an open issue to notify the team of your intention to work on it. \\n\\nFor any other enquiry, please reach out to us via the Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) [Discord](https://discord.gg/bTdZfpc69U).\\n\\n## References \\n\\n* [MACI GitHub repository](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/tree/v1)\\n* [A technical introduction to MACI 1.0 - Kyle Charbonnet](https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to-maci-1-0-db95c3a9439a)\\n* [Minimal anti-collusion infrastructure - Vitalik](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413)\\n* [Pairwise Subsidy](https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553)\\n* [Security Audit](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/blob/v1/audit/202220930_Hashcloak_audit_report.pdf)\\n\\n## Release \\n\\nHere is a link to the new release code in GitHub - [v1.1.1 Release](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/releases/tag/v1.1.1)."}]}')}}]);
