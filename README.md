## Local Development and testing

### Requirements

You should have Node 16 (or 14) installed. Use `nvm` to install it and manage versions.

You also need a Ubuntu/Debian Linux machine on an Intel CPU.

### Get started

Install dependencies:
`sudo apt-get install build-essential libgmp-dev libssl-dev libsodium-dev git nlohmann-json3-dev nasm g++ libgcc-s1`

If you are missing the correct version of glibc see `circuits/scripts/installGlibc.sh`

Clone this repository, install NodeJS dependencies, and build the source code:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:privacy-scaling-explorations/maci.git
cd maci
npm install
npm run bootstrap
npm run build
```

For development purposes, you can generate the proving and verifying keys for
the zk-SNARK circuits, along with their Solidity verifier contracts as such.

Navigate to the rapidsnark [repo](https://github.com/iden3/rapidsnark) to install the necessary tooling.
More details can be found in /docs/installation.md, Section Install `rapidsnark`;

To build the circom circuits, follow the /docs/installation.md, Section Configure circom-helper and zkey-manager. Then run:

```bash
cd circuits
npm run build-test-circuits
```

This can take around 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the specs of your machine.
Once ready, the following will appear on screen:
     ```
     Launched JSON-RPC server at port 9001
     ```

Note that if you change the circuits and recompile them, you should also update
and recompile the verifier contracts in `contracts/contracts` with their new
versions, or the tests will fail:


```bash
cd contracts
npm run compileSol
```

Avoid using `npx hardhat compile` and instead use the provided command as artifacts are copied into their relevant directories.

To build the zk-SNARKs and generate their proving and verifying keys, follow the instructions from /docs/installation.md, 
Section: Generate `.zkey` files.

### Local development

This repository is organised as Lerna submodules. Each submodule contains its
own unit tests.

- `audit`: Documentation surrounding the audit performed on v1
- `crypto`: low-level cryptographic operations.
- `circuits`: zk-SNARK circuits.
- `contracts`: Solidity contracts and deployment code.
- `domainobjs`: Classes which represent high-level [domain
  objects](https://wiki.c2.com/?DomainObject) particular to this project.
- `core`: Business logic functions for message processing, vote tallying,
  and circuit input generation through `MaciState`, a state machine
  abstraction.
- `cli`: A command-line interface with which one can deploy and interact with
  an instance of MACI.
- `integrationTests`: Integration tests which use the command-line interface
  to perform end-to-end tests.

#### Compiling Circom

Prior to using the generated `zkey` files for corresponding circuits, it is now required to compile `circom` locally. To get started the follow the instructions [here](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/)
and be sure that the installation directory matches the value in the `circom` field inside `circuits/circomHelperConfig.json`.

For example:
```json
{
    "circom": "../$RELATIVE_PATH_TO_CIRCOM"
}
```

### Testing

It is implied that the previous steps have been completed before running tests.

### Unit tests

The following submodules contain unit tests: `core`, `crypto`, `circuits`,
`contracts`, and `domainobjs`.

Except for the `contracts` and `circuits` submodule, run unit tests as such (the following
example is for `crypto`):

```bash
cd crypto
npm run test
```

For `circuits`, first build the zk-SNARKs as explained above and then run in one terminal:

```bash
cd circuits
npm run circom-helper
```
wait for *Launched JSON-RPC server at port 9001* message and then run in another terminal:

```bash
cd circuits
npm run test
```

Note that some tests might fail due to jest timeout. You can fix this by adjusting the timeout period defined at the top of the test file.

For example, in the file *MessageToCommand.test.ts*, increase timeout_in_ms on this line: ```jest.setTimeout(<timeout_in_ms>)```.

For `contracts` and `integrationTests`, run the tests one by one. This prevents incorrect nonce errors.

For `contracts`, first, compile the contracts as explained above.

Then, start a Hardhat instance in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd contracts
npm run hardhat
```

In another terminal you can run:

```bash
cd contracts
npm run test
```

Or run tests individual as such:

```bash
cd contracts
npm run test-accQueue
npx jest AccQueue
```

Where both test commands run `AccQueue.test.ts`

Alternatively you can run all unit tests as follows, but you should
stop your Hardhat instance first as this will start its own instance
before running the tests:

```bash
cd contracts
./scripts/runTestsInCi.sh
```

For `integrationTests`, first make sure to install necessary tooling for rapidsnark as explained above, build the zk-SNARKs and generate their proving and verifying keys.

Run all integration tests (this also starts its own Hardhat instance so make sure to kill any running hardhat instance):

```bash
cd integrationTests
./scripts/runTestsInCi.sh
```

### CLI tests

Make sure dependencies are installed, circuits are built, zkeys keys generated and contract compiled.
First run hardhat:

```bash
cd contracts
npm run hardhat
```

Then navigate to /cli/tests/vanilla and execute each test like this:

```bash
cd cli/tests/vanilla
bash ./test1.sh
```
You can find more details about running cli tests in /docs/testing.md.

### Docker

Run `docker build -t maci .` to build all stages.

To run a specific build step `docker build --target circuits -t maci .`
Note: a cached version of `builder` job must be on your system prior as it relies on existing artifacts

### CI pipeline

CI pipeline ensures that we have automated tests that constantly validate. For more information about pipeline workflows, see https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/wiki/MACI-CI-pipeline.
